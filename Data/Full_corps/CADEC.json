warning signs, deterioration was very fast and debilitating -- he was a model totally healthy individual by conventional medical standards.\nMy father was vibrant and could work any teen into the ground for a 75 year old, had great cholesterol numbers, but he was a cardiac patient.\nHe and the cardiologist agreed to go to Lipitor to see if they could drive LDL below 100 (his lipid profile was very, very good by usual medical standards).\nI will say that there was no way any doctor could have known this would happen (my research showed that Lipitor could contribute to this cancer with prior risk factors for it which would have to have been environmental exposure and from what I know of my father's work history experience), but it would help if conventional medicine would listen to patients and their families about experiences that we all are reporting in places such as this.\nMy father could not speak for himself as his form of brain cancer was so aggressive that he went from a

treat them and quit believing those who PROFIT from the sale of their drugs they push on unsuspecting people.\n(What happened to DO NO HARM? ).\nThey have killed my faith in drugs, doctors and the FDA.\nDOCTORS!\nWAKE UP!!\nTHEY ARE MAKING YOU LOOK LIKE FOOLS AND IDIOTS that can be bought for a free lunch or a plate of cookies!\nI also say, get those darn drug ads OFF of TV!.\n", "objects":

Baltimore on business when one night I started experiencing severe pain in one ankle - I could not sleep.\nI was a bit better the next day, but limped around a bit.\nA week later the pain came back, my ankle hurt so much I could hardly make to work.\nI could not walk up the stairs in my house without extreme pain.\nI felt horrible & made an appointment with DOC.\nThought it might be gout, but found this website.\nI quit taking the crap before my appointment with DOC.\nThe nurse told me \"we have a lot of people who complain about pain\".\nDOC understood and has kept me off Statins.\nI wish those who take this stuff successfully the best, but for those of us who have adverse effects this can be deviating.\nIt took me 3-4 weeks to fully recover.\nMD's need to take their patients reports about Lipitor seriously.\nI would rater drink gasoline than take this stuff again! .\nI have to wonder if the effects of this Med are being downplayed by the powers that be.\n????????????.\n",

what it does to the body.\nSo, I decided to stop taking any drug and take some Q10 to build my body back up.\nTwo months later went back on Lipitor with the Q10.\n2 months later, the pain was

hypertension.\nDuring the two years, I was on the Lipitor, all these syptoms started out slowly.\nFirst came the tinnitus.\nMy Dr sent me to the ear Dr.\nFound no problem, I would have to live with it.\nSecond, came depression, Dr put me on Zoloft.\nThen came the sinus problems, Dr put me on Rhinocort.\nDuring all this I felt like I was 80 years old.\nMy neck hurt, my hips hurt.\nWe got a $3,000.00 sleep by number bed to relieve the pain.\nDidn't really help.\nInsomia was constant.\nI got hooked on Tylenol PM.\nI gained a lot of weight.\nWent to Lindora to loss weight, so I could get off the Lipitor.\nLost 40 lbs.\nDr said to stay on Lipitor for prevention.\nThis is when I decided to check it out on the internet.\nWhen I went back on the Lipitor, about 2 months ago, I had a small drink of wine at a wedding.\nThat night my body aches were so bad, I could hardly stand it.\nThen two days later I came down with bronhitis, and asthma.\nI have asthma anyway, but it was the worse case I've had in 13 years.\nThen I had sinus problems again.\nMy Dr took x-rays for pneumonia and sinus infection, Came back clear.\nMy Dr wanted me to see an ear nose and throat Dr Then my blood pressure went up to 198/90.\nI have never in my life had high blood pressure.\nDr put me on Norvasc.\nThen I had two horrible nightmares.\nI finally, went on the internet and looked at side effects for Lipitor.\nWhen I saw all the side-effects, I nearly died.\nI have all the syptoms.\nI stopped taking Lipitor that instant.\nThat was one week ago.\nI'm starting feel a little better.\nI've gone to my Dr and asked him if he new about the alcohol related problem.\nHe said, no.\nThere is no warning on the prescription bottle, to tell you to watch out for a reaction with alcohol.\nThe Dr is now doing tests, to see if there has been any damage to my heart and muscles.\nI also, asked for physical theraphy for my left shoulder and neck.\nMy left shoulder is almost immobile.\nI think the tinnitus in my left ear has been caused by the Lipitor.\nI hope it goes away soon.\nI also, lost my sense of taste during this whole thing.\nI would recommend anyone who has experienced any side effects increased by alcohol, to consider an allergic reaction to the drug.\nDr was thinking about putting on another Statin drug.\nI said, don't you get it, I'm allergic to it.\n.\n", "objects":

This is the 2nd time I got on Lipitor.\nDummy me, got off cause I was not feeling good taking it and was going to have surgery so I got off a couple of months after taking it a couple of months and did feel better.\nBoth times I have taken Lipitor, I have gotten some lower back pain (almost like a disc out of place)impossible to move.\nAfter reading this, I am sure that Lipitor is causing all this.\nI did feel better health and mood and no pain before I started taking this Lipitor both times.\nI am amazed that it didn't dawn on me.\nHave a 5 month supply but getting off quick!.\n",

extent that it is very arthritic or having bad muscle cramps that you never got prior to the drug, it is from the statins.\nThe drug is able to decrease LDL through a mechanism which also destroys and depletes your bodies ability to make CoQ10.\nThis is necessary for they health of muscles and joints (that's why you are experiencing the joint pains and numbness).\nRemember your heart is a muscle, guess what is happening to it with the depletion of the CoQ10???\nIf you do some research on the internet, you will find that all these statins make no claims/nor have studies shown them to reduce heart attacks, but they cause muscle problems i.e. your heart, this is based on the fact that they put younger and younger people on these drugs and.\nI would recommend that you do your own research versus just listening to the doctor who wants your LDL down to like below 130, neurosurgeons, who have studied this would tell you not to get it all too low.\nAnd just because your test come back and show your liver functions are fine and don't show any broken down muscle toxins in the blood doesn't mean the lack of CoQ10 isn't breaking down and damaging your muscles very slowly.\nMine always showed fine and I had severe arthritis symptoms in knees and hip joints (never had this in my life before statins) and bad muscle cramps (also never got those until statins).\nGranted is you have high blood pressure, high LDL, over weight and maybe smoke, then you probably need something to lower the LDL, if you only have high LDL, you don't.\nRead the drug company studies, they even say it may help prevent a heart attack when you have 3 of the aforementioned risk factors.\n", "objects": {"MedEntity": [{"xmiID": "TT1", "spans": [{"begin": 239, "end": 249}, {"begin": 275, "end": 289}],

Lipitor can cause elevated liver enzymes.\nIn clinical trials, this occurred in 0.7 percent of the patients, but the rate was much higher for those taking the 80 mg dose.\nAnother serious side effect of Lipitor and other statins is a condition called rhabdomyolysis, in which muscle cells break down and release potentially toxic cell contents into the bloodstream.,\nSymptoms of rhabdomyolysis include muscle pain, tenderness and weakness--most commonly in the calves and lower back.\nMalaise, fever, dark urine, vomiting and nausea can also be symptoms.\nThe most feared consequence of rhabdomyolysis is acute kidney failure, occurring in 30-40% of the cases.\nSome of the warning signs of liver failure are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, dark urine, and

family doctor suggested that I stop taking Lipitor for 3 days, and see if it has any effect.\nThe effect was dramatic.\nThe cramps did not occur during the night after I did not take the 40 mg with my dinner.\nThey also did not occur on the following two nights.\nI did not want to restart the Lipitor (once a day with the evening meal) for fear that the cramps would just as quickly return.\nSince it was possible that the reason why the night cramps ceased so quickly is that I was taking the 40 mg entirely in the evening, I decided to split the pills and take half in the morning and half in the evening.\nAlthough some mild cramping did return, it was nowhere close to what I had been experiencing, and this has c.\n", "objects": {"MedEntity": [{"xmiID": "TT1", "spans": [{"begin": 19, "end":
